# Angle Selector

This project is an interactive angle selector built with React. It allows users to select an angle value between 0 and 360 degrees using a text input, slider, and radio buttons. The selected angle is visually represented using a pie chart that displays the angle in a circle.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Users can enter a numeric value directly into a text box. The value is constrained to be between 0 and 360.
- **Slider**: A range slider allows users to select an angle value by sliding left or right. The slider is centered at 0 degrees, with values ranging from -180 to 180, translating to a 0-360 degree representation.
- **Radio Buttons**: A set of predefined angle values (0°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 180°) can be selected using radio buttons.
- **Visual Representation**: The selected angle is shown in a pie chart using SVG, with the angle value displayed at the center of the circle.
